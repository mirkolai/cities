**Title:** *Understanding the interplay between urban segregation and accessibility to services with network analysis*  

**Abstract:** This paper proposes to exploit complex network analysis to evaluate walkable accessibility to services in cities, and how this relates to connectivity provided by the urban transport system. The main research question is whether the hyper-proximity paradigm, of which the popular 15-minute city is an instance, plays a role in urban segregation, increasing the risk of ghettoization and social exclusion in cities and neighborhoods that adhere to this model. We present an analytical approach that includes the quantification of both accessibility to services and urban segregation and allows for detailed comparisons between different cities and different urban areas. The concept of hyper-proximity emphasizes the importance of having basic services and amenities within a few minutes' walk or bike ride to enhance urban livability and sustainability. By modeling cities as complex networks, we analyze various metrics to capture the relationships and accessibility patterns within urban spaces at different scales: residential addresses, network clusters (in place of administrative neighborhoods), and whole cities. Our methodology evaluates the distribution of relevant Points of Interests (PoIs) and how the urban transport network efficiently connects residential areas within a city. In particular, we suggest using closeness centrality as a metric to quantify urban segregation. We found out that accessibility to services and closeness are at interplay, and the co-existence of apparently contradictory patterns emerges world wide: in fact, we observe that areas with poor/good accessibility to services tend to exhibit poor/good urban transport connectivity at different scales, but also that the fraction of citizens who are poorly served is not equally distributed worldwide. Altogether, for Italian cities for which income data were available, we show how disparities in access to essential services can often be interpreted in terms of other socio-economic inequalities so that poorer accessibility and connectivity are likely to be manifested in lower income' neighborhoods. More interestingly, we observed some outliers suggesting that higher income neighborhoods may eventually tend towards voluntary isolation.


# Data Availability
All data used in this study were collected from publicly accessible third-party sources, accessed and collected in 2025, and the authors did not have any special access privileges for any of these datasets.

These sources include: 
- **OpenStreetMap** – for maps and Points of Interest (PoIs) using the OpenStreetMap Application Programming Interface, accessed via standard API endpoints (https://www.openstreetmap.org; https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API)
- **WorldPop** – for population density data (https://www.worldpop.org/)
- **Transitland** – for GTFS transit feeds (https://www.transit.land/). For Italian cities and Istanbul, we have manually compiled a list of the open data links providing GTFS datasets we used in the analysis.
- for Italian cities only, official data on average resident income for the year 2022 from the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (https://tinyurl.com/bdcww24t).

The data collection procedures and analytical methods are fully described in the `Data and Methods` sections of the manuscript. The scripts used for data collection and analysis are provided in the `Reproducibility` section of this repository to ensure transparency and reproducibility. By following the procedures outlined in the `Reproducibility` section, other researchers can retrieve the data directly from the original third-party sources and replicate the study’s findings in their entirety, subject to any updates to those sources.

Additionally, this repository includes, in the `plotting_scripts` folder, the scripts used to generate the figures supporting the conclusions of the manuscript, along with a dataset of processed data containing all the information necessary to reproduce these figures, as well as to calculate the descriptive statistics and rankings reported in the manuscript.

# Reproducibility

By running the provided scripts, users can download and preprocess the required datasets to replicate the entire analysis workflow. An example of the process output that will be generated by the scripts and saved in the `output` folder for the city of Turin is included in the `output_example` folder.

## Script Execution Order  

The scripts must be executed in the following order:  

## 1. `_compute_PoI_accessibility.py`  

This script requires the most computational resources in terms of execution time and memory.  

### **Operations performed:**  
- Checks if the city has already been processed.  
- Loads population data from WorldPop.  
- Builds the city graph from OpenStreetMap.  
- Extends the graph for better isochrone computations.  
- Extracts Points of Interest (PoIs) from the extended graph.  
- Uses parallel processing to compute accessibility metrics in batches.  


### **Generated files (per city):**  
- `data/worldpop/{country}` – A raster file from WorldPop with population estimates (downloaded once per country and used for all cities in that nation).  
- `output/{place_name}.graphml.gz` – The city's road network extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM).  
- `output/{place_name} extended.graphml.gz` – An expanded version of the city's bounding box, covering the maximum travel distance reachable within the set time and speed constraints.  
- `output/{place_name}.csv.gz` – A file containing Points of Interest (PoIs) retrieved from OSM.  

## 2. `_recover_GTFS_feeds.py`  

Retrieves GTFS feeds using the Transit.land API.  
### **Generated files (per city):**  
- `data/GTFS/Feeds/{place_name}.json}` dictionary containing the list of feeds recovered by transit.land

> **Note:** Registration on the platform and obtaining an API key are required.  

## 3. `_download_GTFS_from_feed.py`  

Downloads GTFS files from the feeds obtained in step 2.  
### **Generated files (per city):**  
- `data/GTFS/{feed_id} {place_name}.zip` list of GTFS zips for each feed

## 4. `_create_public_transit_graph.py`  

Integrates public transport data (GTFS) into the road network.  
- Produces the file: `{place_name} - walk & transit.graphml.gz`  
- This network is compatible with **networkx** and **osmnx**.  

## 5. `_compute_pop.py`  

Since WorldPop TIFF files provide population density in 100-meter cells, this script:  
- Determines how many intersections fall within each cell.  
- Distributes the population equally among the intersections.  

### **Generated file:**  
- `output/{place_name} Pop.json.gz` – A dictionary with:  
  - **Key:** Node ID  
  - **Value:** Estimated population  

## 6. `_compute_infomap.py`  

Generates clusters within the road network.  

### **Generated files:**  
- `output/{place_name} infomap.json.gz` – A dictionary with:  
  - **Key:** Node ID  
  - **Value:** Cluster ID  
- `output/{place_name} infomap.pickle` – A dictionary with:  
  - **Key:** Cluster ID  
  - **Value:** Convex and concave cluster polygons  

## 7. `_compute_closeness.py`  

Computes **closeness centrality** for all intersections in the combined road and public transport network.  

### **Generated file:**  
- `output/{place_name} closeness.json.gz` – A dictionary with:  
  - **Key:** Node ID  
  - **Value:** Closeness centrality score

Each script must be executed in sequence to ensure full reproducibility of the analysis. 🚀
